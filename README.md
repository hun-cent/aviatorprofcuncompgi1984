## Aviator Game Guide: How to Play the Game

The Aviator game is easy to learn but requires a good strategy to win.
Here's a quick guide to help you get started.

### Basic Gameplay

The game revolves around a plane that takes off, and your objective is
to cash out your bet before the plane flies away. The longer the plane
stays on the screen, the higher your multiplier, but if you don't cash
out in time, you lose your bet.

-   **Place a Bet** -- Before each round starts, you can place one or
    two bets.
-   **Monitor the Multiplier** -- The multiplier increases as the plane
    flies, and you can cash out at any point to lock in your winnings.
-   **Cash Out** -- Cashing out before the plane flies away is key to
    winning the game. The higher the multiplier, the greater the risk,
    so time your cash-out carefully.

### Winning Strategies

-   **Low-risk strategy**: Cash out early for smaller but consistent
    wins.
-   **High-risk strategy**: Wait for the multiplier to increase
    significantly, but know you may lose if the plane flies away.
